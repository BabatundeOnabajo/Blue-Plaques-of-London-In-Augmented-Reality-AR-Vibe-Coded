# Blue-Plaques-of-London-In-Augmented-Reality-AR-Vibe-Coded
This is a mobile phone game that users can play in London. It involves hovering your phone over a blue plaque on a building organised by the English Heritage charity and you will be asked a number of questions in a quiz about the person commemorated by the plaque. 

# Technical Background
The app was built partly (although not entirely, see below under the section "Extent of assistance with 'vibe coding'" for further information) with "vibe coding" which describes the creation of programs through Large Language Models (LLMs) and natural human language. This was done through the following platforms (in order of most used to least used):
1. Amazon Bedrock - Claude Opus 4.1
2. Amazon Bedrock - Claude Opus 4.5
3. ChatGPT
Three LLM platforms were used rather than the more usual one because the augmented reality toolkit provided by Google, called ARCore, is not well-documented and has inconsistent documentation. Furthermore, some platforms outperformed certain aspects of the app development process than others. That it took three LLM platforms to create this app rather than just one highlights the complexity of the Android app development process.
